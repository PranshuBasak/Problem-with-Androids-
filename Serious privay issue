This comment i have found out in a secured chat room and is it really disturbing ,  we should take a step back and  thing about it .
" I’m pretty sure there’s a native backdoor in each mobile phone, secretly installed by each phone manufacturer, that allows to 
remotely activate camera, recording, and access to phone’s data (contacts, agenda, etc.). This function can be used with just 
the victim’s phone number, followed by a special code with numbers, sharps and other special chars in it (a long string).
Problem is only few people have access to these special codes databases, each phone model has its own. And I have
no idea about how to get this code from a mobile device, otherwise I would have tried on my own one immediately.
I used to work for one of these (well-known) companies, that build phones. I can tell you that functionality has always existed,
since the first mobile phone with an embedded camera has been built. 
I can’t imagine that phone manufacturers have not stopped to do it, for a lot of reasons (technical, commercial, even political…)."
